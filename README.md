### Master Thesis: Methods and Tools for Gamespace Engineering: Designing a Web-based Application to Assist the Planning Process of Gamespaces
This thesis collects methods and tools for level design from various scientific resources, classifies them in an adaptable model and publishes the collection on a website. The goal was not only to build a single pool of resource for game designers to access, but also to collaborate on the knowledge in the future.

### Bachelor Thesis: 


### CardME
CardMe is a hypothetical subscription service that offers users to send physical customisable and thoughtful cards to friends and relatives. This was a university project that was praised for its technical implementation. We used REST API and SpringBoot to implement the client and server technology, including a Paypal payment service and dividing the work equally between us. One year later, the project was published on the university's website to serve as inspiration for future projects.
- Team size: 4 people
- Used technologies: SpringBoot, JavaScript, REST, MongoDB
- Grade: 1.0 for the project (1.0/4.0, the best possible grade in Germany)

### SAP Analytics
This project served the purpose to get familiar with SAP technologies and with the SAP HANA database, specifically. The goal was to analyze the learning behavior of our business partner's colleagues (data extracted from MSG). To do that, we created a web service that visualized the data given to us according to specified filters, such as the country the learners come from, the business unit, etc. The service also contains information about the courses offered by the MSG learning platform and functionality for the website's manager.
- Team size: 4 people
- Used technologies: SAP, SAP HANA, SAP Business Application Studios
- Grade: 2.0 (2.0/4.0)

### Maze Walker
This was the final project of a shader course in university, teaching us how to program different kinds of shaders in Unity. The result was a simple maze runner game that included shaders for portals, snow, footprints, fog and dissolve.
- Team size: 4 people
- Used technologies: OpenGL, C#, Unity
- Grade: 2.3 (2.3/4.0)
